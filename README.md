### About

Move Planner is a Web App that invokes `Ajax` requests from Google Street View API, The NYT article search API, and The Wikipedia API.
When you submit your `Street` and `City` It uses `jQuery` to update background page to a Street View image, adding latest articles from The NY Times about your City, and adding related articles from Wikipedia as well.
